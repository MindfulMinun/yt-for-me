User Journey:

Someone searches for a video, finds it, selects download, selects their format,
chooses convert.

Convert should add the video to the queue (bottom sheet). The sheet can be
expanded to show the progression of the video conversion and download. Once done,
the sheet will show the download URL and store previous url downloads in localhost
(to persist when the user navigates away). Maybe we can notify the user can be
notified via a push notification?
